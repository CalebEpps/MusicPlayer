    <string name="tutTextOne">Circle Player is a music app that plays music. But what does that mean?
                            We\'re glad you asked! Have you ever used Spotify? Now imagine if
                            4 college students were tasked with making Spotify, but only one of them had Android experience.
                            That\'s how Circle Player was born!</string>
    <string name="tuttextTwo">To get started, hit the Select Songs button and select some audio files from your device.
                            Currently, Circle Player supports MP3, OGG, M4A, and WAV files. Once your songs are added, congrats!
                            You\'ve made what\'s commonly referred to as a Playlist.</string>
    <string name="tutTextThree">To edit a song\'s properties, select the song by long tapping (holding your finger down on it).
                            A window will open up that will allow you to edit the song or delete it. Magic! If
                            Ensure that you have given the app full storage permissions (especially on Android Q+).
                            Please consider leaving us 3 stars for only being a minor inconvenience!</string>
